To run your Express.js application in Visual Studio Code (VSCode), you need to follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and NPM
Make sure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system:

You can check if Node.js is installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
bash
Copy
node -v
npm -v
If they're not installed, you can download and install them from Node.js official site.
2. Set Up Your Project in VSCode
2.1. Create a New Folder for Your Project (If you haven't already)
You can do this either through the terminal or through VSCode's File Explorer.

2.2. Open Your Project in VSCode
If you already have a folder containing your index.js (or the file with your code) and want to open it in VSCode, follow these steps:

Open VSCode.
Click on File → Open Folder... → select the folder where your code is located.
3. Install Dependencies
You need to install the necessary dependencies (Express, Passport, and the Google OAuth strategy). You can do this by using npm (Node Package Manager):

3.1. Initialize NPM in Your Project Folder
If you haven't already initialized your project with npm, open the terminal in VSCode (you can press Ctrl + ~ to open the terminal) and run the following command:

bash
Copy
npm init -y
This will create a package.json file in your project folder.

3.2. Install Required Packages
You need to install express, express-session, passport, and passport-google-oauth20:

In your VSCode terminal, run the following command:

bash
Copy
npm install express express-session passport passport-google-oauth20
4. Run Your Application
4.1. Create Your index.js File (or another file name)
Make sure that the code you've provided is saved in a file, e.g., index.js or app.js.

4.2. Start the Application
To start your server, run the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy
node index.js
If your file is named something other than index.js, replace index.js with the appropriate file name.

4.3. Access the App in Your Browser
Once the server starts, open your web browser and go to:

arduino
Copy
http://localhost:3000
You should see the message:

Welcome! Login with Google

You can click on the Login with Google link, which will redirect you to Google's OAuth login page.
